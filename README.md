# exp-solver

This repository contains the source code for `exp-solver`, a simple command-line application for evaluating and numerically solving complex mathematical expressions.

## Features

This application includes methods of evaluating and solving expressions written basic mathematical notation. The currently supported features include
 - methods of evaluating expressions
 - methods of solving expressions using the hillclimbing optimisation algorithm
 - methods of adding additional variable bindings using the `where` clause (`'a+b' where a=1 b=2`)
 - support for complex numbers and vectors
 - support for first-class and higher-order functions
 - support for basic arithmetic operations
 - support for common mathematical functions
 - support for basic, inverse, secant, and hyperbolic trigonometric functions
 - support for common mathematical constants `i`, `e`, `pi`, `tau`, and `phi`
